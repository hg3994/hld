Leadership Principles
=====================

Try to answer a question in 3mins.

There was a problem in a build flow. Sounds simple but a complicated problem build time. Sounds a trivial problem.
My task was to make it resumable.

Asked for feedback from customers.

Problem: 
	Not a resumable build. It magnifies when the build time is huge. Some of the chips take 22hrs to build. A chip takes 2 years to build and 70% of the time is spent in it.

	
Did a quick thing and collected the data that so much of build time 

Went to the team understanding the problem.
How are you doing it? => I created a save-file system. Depndency Graph is saved.
Challenges => Global Variables, saving depndency, 
Results => 90%. Deployed across different business units. 
	Ended up creating thorough documentation. Kept the feature it simple.
Guidelines for projects. Regression tests.
Others =>
	Contact Lead for understanding why are we facing such a problem.

Would you have done anything differently? => 

S - Sitation (Problem) for 1 min
T - Task for 20secs
A - Action for 2mins
	- First I did analysis
	- Brought some data on Why am I doing it
	- Created Roadmap
	- What work did I do?
R - Results for 2 mins


Why were you not the owner of Pradeep's story? => Primary area of ownership (much larger number of stake holders involved ... I knew what was happening behind the scenes... )

Documentation => How did you make sure that the documentation never got stale. We review all the documentation once a month for 30mins.
Customer Documentation / API, Developer Documentation.
